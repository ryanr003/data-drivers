### What is Formula 1?

Key Components of Formula 1:

1. Drivers – 20 total drivers (this can be more, but typically there are only 20 in a season)
2. Teams – Companies or manufacturers (like Ferrari, Mercedes, and Red Bull) that build the cars and manage the racing
   operations.
3. Cars – There are different classes of Formula racing Formula 4, 3, 2, and what we are working with, Formula 1. F1
   use the fastest cars.
4. Circuits – Tracks where races are held, including both permanent racetracks and temporary street circuits all around
   the world.

### Key Elements

**1. Races and Championship**

Each season consists of multiple races in different countries. Points are awarded based on race finishes, and the driver
and team with the most points at the end of the season win the respective championships.

There is a "Drivers' Championship" and a "Constructors' Championship"

At the end of a race, the final positions determine how many points are awarded. Here is an example from the first race
of 2024 in Bahrain:

| POS | NO | DRIVER     | CAR                          | LAPS | TIME/RETIRED | PTS |
|-----|----|------------|------------------------------|------|--------------|-----|
| 1   | 1  | Verstappen | Red Bull Racing Honda RBPT   | 57   | 1:31:44.742  | 26  |
| 2   | 11 | Perez      | Red Bull Racing Honda RBPT   | 57   | +22.457s     | 18  |
| 3   | 55 | Sainz      | Ferrari                      | 57   | +25.110s     | 15  |
| 4   | 16 | Leclerc    | Ferrari                      | 57   | +39.669s     | 12  |
| 5   | 63 | Russell    | Mercedes                     | 57   | +46.788s     | 10  |
| 6   | 4  | Norris     | McLaren Mercedes             | 57   | +48.458s     | 8   |
| 7   | 44 | Hamilton   | Mercedes                     | 57   | +50.324s     | 6   |
| 8   | 81 | Piastri    | McLaren Mercedes             | 57   | +56.082s     | 4   |

| 10  | 18 | Stroll     | Aston Martin Aramco Mercedes | 57   | +93.216s     | 1   |
| 11  | 24 | Zhou       | Kick Sauber Ferrari          | 56   | +1 lap       | 0   |
| 12  | 20 | Magnussen  | Haas Ferrari                 | 56   | +1 lap       | 0   |
| 13  | 3  | Ricciardo  | RB Honda RBPT                | 56   | +1 lap       | 0   |
| 14  | 22 | Tsunoda    | RB Honda RBPT                | 56   | +1 lap       | 0   |
| 15  | 23 | Albon      | Williams Mercedes            | 56   | +1 lap       | 0   |
| 16  | 27 | Hulkenberg | Haas Ferrari                 | 56   | +1 lap       | 0   |
| 17  | 31 | Ocon       | Alpine Renault               | 56   | +1 lap       | 0   |
| 18  | 10 | Gasly      | Alpine Renault               | 56   | +1 lap       | 0   |
| 19  | 77 | Bottas     | Kick Sauber Ferrari          | 56   | +1 lap       | 0   |
| 20  | 2  | Sargeant   | Williams Mercedes            | 55   | +2 laps      | 0   |

Points are awarded to the top 10 drivers. Starting with 25 points, then 18, 15, 12, 10, etc. There is an additional
point awarded to the driver with the fastest lap. In this race, Max Verstappen, the winner had the fastest lap which is
why he had 26 points.

At the end of the season, the driver with the most points wins the "Drivers' Championship".

For the "Constructors' Championship, you add the total points from both of your drivers. In this case, Sergio Perez and
Max
Verstappen (both race for Red Bull), had the most amount of points possible at the end of the first race so Red Bull was
leading the championship at the end of this race.

In 2024, Max Verstappen won the drivers' championship with 437 points. But, his teammate Sergio Perez, did not perform
well and McLaren won the Constructors' Championship.

Teams are awarded prize money at the end of the season. Below are some prize money estimates, but give you an idea of
why winning races is so important to teams:

| Constructors’ Finishing Position | Estimated Prize Money ($) |

**2. The Race Weekend**

A typical race weekend consists of:

- Practice Sessions: Drivers test the car and learn the track.

- Qualifying: Determines the starting grid for the race, based on the fastest laps.

- The Race: The main event where drivers compete for position over a set number of laps.

### Tire Strategies

Tire management is one of the most critical elements of F1 strategy. The tires play a major role in determining how well
a car performs, and each tire type has its own strengths and weaknesses. Teams must plan when to switch tires during the
race to ensure the car performs at its best while maximizing speed and minimizing time lost in the pit stops.

**1. Types of Tires**

Pirelli, the tire supplier of F1, provides different types of tires for various conditions:
- Soft Tires: Fastest but wear out quickly. (Red)
- Medium Tires: A balanced option, offering a good mix of speed and durability. (Yellow)
- Hard Tires: Last longer but provide less grip and are slower. (White)
- Intermediates: Used in light rain; they provide good grip on wet surfaces. (Green)
- Full Wet Tires: Used in heavy rain; they offer maximum grip on wet tracks. (Blue)

**2. Tire Strategy**

Tire strategy revolves around when to switch tires to maximize performance while minimizing time in the pits. Key
factors to consider include:

- Track Conditions: The weather and surface conditions affect tire performance. If it starts raining, teams may need to
switch to wet-weather tires.

- Race Length: Longer races require careful tire management to avoid excessive wear.

- Pit Stops: Changing tires during a pit stop can take about 2-3 seconds, but a poor strategy can result in losing
positions or wasting time.

### Pit Stop Strategies

Teams plan tire changes based on the track, weather, and the performance of the tires. The goal is to optimize the
number of tire changes while minimizing time spent in the pit.

- One-stop Strategy: Some races allow a strategy where a team changes tires only once. This is often used when tire wear
is low, and the track temperature is ideal.

- Two or Three-stop Strategies: In races with high tire degradation, teams may opt for multiple pit stops to maximize
performance by using fresh tires.

**1. Tire Wear**

As the tires degrade, they lose grip, affecting lap times. The degradation rate depends on multiple factors, such as:

- Track Temperature: Hotter tracks cause faster tire wear.

- Driving Style: Aggressive driving can increase tire wear.

- Tire Pressure: Correct tire pressure ensures optimal grip and longevity.

- Pace: The pace a driver maintains throughout the race significantly impacts tire wear. Faster lap times put more
  strain on the tires, causing them to wear more quickly. A balanced pace that avoids pushing the tires too hard can
  help extend their lifespan. Conversely, a slower pace can help preserve tire life but may cost valuable seconds per
  lap.

Teams need to balance speed with tire conservation throughout the race. Sometimes, even if a driver is fast on fresh
tires, they may need to slow down to ensure the tires last.
