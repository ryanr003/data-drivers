## 2025-02-17: Acquire Data Milestone


### Data Wrangling:



### Project Goals:

<uRyan:</u>

Our main project goal is still to create a data dashboard that explains and discovers new findings in the F1 datasets our team pulled from the F1 website. To break it down even more, some current goals are to find trends with the weather data, pit stop data, stints data, and laps data and join them to find correlations between them. So, the scientific question we are trying to address currently here is: Is there a correlation/trend between the x data set and the y data set? Knowing our audience is current and future DS 4010 students, if we do find any significant trends within our different datasets, our group will start to create rough drafts of data visualizations that we could potentially put in our final data dashboard.
