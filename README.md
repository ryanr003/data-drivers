## Purpose:
The purpose of this repository is to create a data dashboard based on raw data found from the OpenF1 website (https://openf1.org). This project uses the Drivers, Pit, Sessions, and 
Stints data from the website in the form of a .csv file. Our group uses R to explore, clean, and find models to discover significant findings within the datasets. All data visuals 
and statistics from the final dashboard come from this repository.
